            <h2>Unfortunately, as of August 2023, the <a href='https://www.boardgameatlas.com' target='_blank'>Board Game Atlas API</a> has been shut down.</h2>
            <p>This means that HTTP requests to this API cannot be made, and therefore, no games can be browsed. This is a bummer because a large portion of my project revolves around this API. I will say, though, that since this was my first major project since graduating from my bootcamp, it has helped tremendously in my understanding of fetch calls and asynchronous functions. In the future, I may try to recreate this page using a different API (perhaps the Board Game Geek API), but for now, I believe this project has served its purpose for me in providing a foundation of asynchronous functions for future projects.</p>
